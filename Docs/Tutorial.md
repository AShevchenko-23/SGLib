# SGLib Getting started
This section is in progress.

## From the author
Writing documentation in a not native language turned out to be harder than expected.\
SGLib is very similar to known graphics APIs, especially DirectX. So, if you have some experience with rendering, learning SGLib shouldn't be a problem for you at all.\
Here I tried to tell about features and capabilities by code samples instead of boring and clumsy narrations.
It should help for getting started.

I'm sorry for my English and I hope a clumsy narration won't be a significant obstacle to learning SGLib. :)\
It will be better very soon.
